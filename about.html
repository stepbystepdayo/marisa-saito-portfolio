            To me, design is all about telling a story. A good design tells clients stories through thoughtful design decisions,
            thus creating a functional, efficient and beautiful space. As a designer, I understand the importance of each design
            phase and its role in an interior. From design concept, to color palettes, to the architecture and furnishings that fill
            it, each element is essential to a successful project.
            Interior designer with experience in commercial design. Team player, positive, dependable, creative, problem solver,
            versatile. Passionate about telling a story and using colors, textures and patterns to justify it. Enjoy creating
            functional, aesthetic, spaces for clients and users.
